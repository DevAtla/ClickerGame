i made this game in like a few hours after learning html, js, css in 2 days.
i dont really care what you do take from my files what ever you want as long as you dont nuke the whole universe.
so i want a job that pays me hourly and pays 10000/h.
i know its too low for my profesionality but its what its...
not 10000 cents, but 10000 DOLLARS, USD, $$$, United States Dollars.
